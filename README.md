# SAS
Getting SASSY with _SAS_. Featured in this repo are some Macros, Utilities, Resources and documents I ocassionally use. This is currently a WIP and will be updated whenever I have "free time". 

## Resources  
* [Lex Jansen](http://www.lexjansen.com/): A website contains a curated source of SAS proceedings and publications. This is an excellent resource 
* [SAS Communities](https://communities.sas.com/): A support/discussion forum for all SAS related things.
* If you know of additional resources, please let me know and I can have it added here.
